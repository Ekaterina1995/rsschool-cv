## About me
A journalist by education, I am a programmer at heart. I like to learn new things, solve complex problems and improve myself. And the key to my success is daily practice. At the moment I'm just studying to be a web-developer, but I can already make you a simple website. It will cost you less than making by a senior, and it will be a plus in the portfolio and a review of a satisfied client.
